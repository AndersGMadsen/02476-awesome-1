A short description of the project.

### breast tissue segmentation

## Overall Goal

The aim of the project is to use MLOps methods learned in the course to create a pipeline for segmentation of breat tissue.

## The Framework (update)

Working with computer vision, the [PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) framework is a sensible choice.

## Using the Framework
Use pretrained encoder and own decoder to train the data. encoder was based on resnet.

## Data
We use 151 imiges of breat tissue that are really large. We process the images to smaller ones at 512x512. The data is  

##
The model is Unet based on resnet10.
