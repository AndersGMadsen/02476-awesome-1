A short description of the project.

### Counting Plant Tumors using Computer Vision

## Overall Goal

The aim of the project is to use MLOps methods learned in the course to contribute to a pipeline for Chr. Hansen that includes inference of images (counting tumors) from lab equipment using computer vision

## The Framework (update)

Working with computer vision, the [PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) framework is a sensible choice.

## Using the Framework
Use pretrained models to train the data. Depending on what works, maybe add things on top. 

## Data
We use the data provided by Chr. Hansen which consists of images uploded from microscopes. The data might need prepping. 

##
The model is provided by Chr. Hansen and we expect some kind of CNN (U-net etc.)
